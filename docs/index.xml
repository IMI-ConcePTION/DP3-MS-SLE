      <description>D4_DU_prevalence_MS_in_pregnancy_cohortcontains the aggregated prevalence (numerators and denominators) needed to compute prevalence of MS in the pregnancy cohort, to feed Template 4 and 5
D4_DU_individual_prevalence_of_use_MSmeds_in_MSpregnancy_trimestersthis dataset measures in each MS pregnancy whether the woman used or didn&amp;#39;t use each of the MS medications in the trimesters before or during pregnancy (to ultimately feed Template 3)
D4_DU_prevalence_of_exclusive_use_MSmeds_in_MSpregnancy_trimestersthis is the aggregation of the individual-level dataset D4_DU_individual_prevalence_of_use_MSmeds_in_MSpregnancy_trimesters, to feed Template 3. It contains counts of persons using medicines exclusively in some periods before and during pregnancy</description>

      <description>D3_personscontains the cleaned version of PERSONS, where birth date and death date are reconstituted as dates
D3_output_spells_categorycontains the spells exited from CreateSpells, i.e., all the continuous spells of observation period of each person, stratified per op_meaning. op_meaning is by default the same for all observation periods, and is set in 05_subpopulations_restricting_meanings for those data sources where the analysis is conducted on subpopulations having different sets of data banks
