When she enters the study she is in the ageband 20-24. She turns 25 in 2013, so she contributes 2 records on that year, except for the ageband 'all' . She turns positive for MS1 (the first algorithm for MS) during 2011. She does contribute to the 5-year period 2005-2009, although she is only briefly observed there. Even in the 5-year band she contributes two records in 2010-2014, one per the age band 20-24 and one for 25-29.
